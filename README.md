Hackintosh folder and short guide for a 3900x

This is all built in Mojave (I plan to update this to Catalina or Big Sur soon)

If you have identical hardware, you should be all set to go.

1. Make mojave installer (look on Dotrina opencore for how to)
2. Mount the EFI
3. Replace everything in the EFI folder with what's in my EFI folder
4. Change the following BIOS Settings
5. Make sure you disable all boot-configuration locks in the BIOS. Disable CFG lock if it's an option, disable secure boot, fast boot, and any windows features that are available in the BIOS.

Here's my hardware:
